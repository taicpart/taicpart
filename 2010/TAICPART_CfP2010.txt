CALL FOR PAPERS

Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference -
Practice and Research Techniques (TAIC PART 2010)

Windsor, United Kingdom
September 3 - 5, 2010

2010/

Theme and Goals:
----------------
TAIC PART is a conference that aims to forge collaboration between
industry and academia on the challenging and exciting problem of
software testing. It is sponsored by representatives of both industry
and academia, bringing together commercial and industrial software
developers and users with academic researchers working on the theory
and practice of software testing. The goals of TAIC PART range from
the articulation of fundamental research questions in the field of
software testing and analysis to practical challenges that are often
faced by software developers in industry.  TAIC PART is a unique event
that strives to combine the important aspects of a software testing
conference, workshop, and retreat.

Keynote Speakers:
-----------------
Dr Wolfgang Grieskamp, Microsoft, USA
Prof Sir Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK
Prof Bertrand Meyer, ETH Zuerich, Switzerlad

Call for Papers:
----------------
TAIC PART 2010 solicits papers on, but is not limited to, the
following areas:

- Test Adequacy Criteria
- Test Suite Execution
- Test Coverage Monitoring
- Automated Test Data Generation
- Regression Testing
- Automated Debugging and Fault Localization
- Performance Evaluation
- Static and Dynamic Analysis
- Verification and Validation
- Software Reliability Engineering
- Model-Based Testing

Submissions:
------------
We invite submission of papers of the following types:

- Full papers (16 pages): Original research
- Short papers (8 pages): Experience reports, tool papers, challenge
   papers, PhD papers
- Fast Abstracts (4 pages)

Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper through the TAIC
PART 2010 paper submission site. Papers must be written in English,
and prepared according to Springer's LNCS style (guidelines:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). All papers will
undergo a rigorous review by at least three members of the program
committee.

- Original research papers will explore novel software testing ideas
and techniques. These papers should furnish a detailed theoretical or
empirical evaluation of the proposed approach.

- Experience reports should provide practical and generalizable
insights into how to apply and extend existing approaches to
software testing and analysis and will be evaluated with respect to the
significance and generality of the described testing experience.

- Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation
of software testing and analysis tools and will be judged by the
technical merit, novelty, and evaluation of the tool.

- Challenge papers describe a real-world software testing problem for
which academics seek help from industry or vice versa and will be
assessed according to their ability to forge partnerships and
ultimately yield successful solutions.

- PhD papers are for PhD students who are interested in receiving
feedback about dissertation research that is an early stage. There
will be a dedicated PhD session at the conference.

- Fast Abstract papers are short papers that describes late breaking
results or works in progress and will be evaluated according to their
ability to generate discussion and suggest interesting areas for
future research.
