-----------------
  Theme and Goals
-----------------

   The Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference 2008 (TAIC PART
   2008) establishes a forum for the publication of papers related to
   software testing and analysis.  The theme of TAIC PART is
   "transferring software testing technology from academia to
   industry."  TAIC PART aims to forge collaborations between industry
   and academia.  The goals of TAIC PART 2008 include the articulation
   of fundamental research questions in the field of software testing
   and analysis.  TAIC PART also focuses on the practical challenges
   that are often faced by software developers in industry.

-----------------
  Call for Papers
-----------------

   TAIC PART 2008 solicits experience, tool, original research,
   industry challenge, and academic challenge papers that explore
   software testing and analysis techniques.  Research topics include,
   but are not limited to, the following areas:
    
     Test Adequacy Criteria
     Test Suite Execution
     Test Coverage Monitoring
     Automated Test Data Generation
     Regression Testing
     Automated Debugging and Fault Localization
     Performance Evaluation
     Static and Dynamic Analysis
     Verification and Validation
     Software Reliability Engineering
     Model-Based Testing
     Testing and Formal Methods
     Testing and Model Checking
     Software Testing Process
     Technology Transfer

   TAIC PART solicits papers that focus on the testing and analysis of
   software applications that include, but are not limited to, the
   following types:

     Embedded and Real-Time Systems
     Operating Systems 
     Parallel, Distributed, and Cluster Applications
     Service-Oriented Software Systems
     Web Applications
     Event-Based Systems
     File and Storage Systems
     Virtual Machine-Based Applications
     Database Applications

     Graphical User Interfaces
     Wireless Sensor Networks
     Safety Critical Systems
     AI and Machine Learning Systems
     Business Applications

-----------------
  Types of Papers
-----------------

    - Experience reports should provide practical and generalizable
      insights into how to apply and extend existing approaches to
      software testing and analysis. 

    - Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and
      evaluation of software testing and analysis tools. 

    - Original Research papers will explore novel software testing
      techniques.  These papers should furnish a detailed theoretical
      and/or empirical evaluation of the proposed approach.

    - Industry Challenge papers must have at least one author whose
      affiliation in non-academic.  These papers will describe a
      real-world software testing problem for which help is sought
      from the academic research community. 

    - Academic Challenge papers must have at least one author
      whose affiliation in non-industry.  These papers should explain
      a software testing research problem for which help is sought
      from industry partners. 

------------------
  Paper Evaluation
------------------

    All papers will undergo a rigorous examination by at least
    three members of the program committee. The Program Co-Chairs and
    the Program Committee will provide thoughtful and fair reviews
    that furnish detailed insights into ways for improving and
    extending the papers.  All submitted papers will be
    evaluated according to (i) relevance to the conference themes and
    goals and (ii) clarity and organization. 

    - Experience reports will be evaluated with respect to the
      significance and generality of the described testing experience.

    - Research and tool papers will be judged by the technical merit,
      novelty, and evaluation of the described technique or tool.

    - Industry and academic challenge papers will be assessed
      according to their ability to forge partnerships and ultimately
      yield successful solutions.

    The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished
    and should not be under review at other workshops, conferences, or
    journals.
 
------------------
  Paper Formatting
------------------

    Papers should be formatted using the IEEE conference style
    format. Including all references and figures, a research paper
    must not exceed the ten page limit and the experience, tool, and
    industry and academic challenge papers should not be longer than
    five pages.  Papers should have an abstract that is no longer than
    150 words. Please be aware that if your paper is accepted, the
    abstract may appear in the advance program and on the TAIC PART
    2008 Web site.  Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper
    through the TAIC PART 2008 paper submission site.

------------------------
  Conference Proceedings
------------------------

    The accepted papers will be published with ISBN by the IEEE
    Computer Society and they will appear in the IEEE digital library.
    The presentations for all of the accepted papers will also be
    provided for download on the TAIC PART 2008 Web site.  The
    Conference Chair and Program Co-Chairs have arranged for a special
    section of Information and Software Technology to contain extended
    and revised versions of selected papers from TAIC PART 2008.
