     <h1>Introduction</h1>

	      <p>
		Among computer science and software engineering
		activities, <b>software testing</b> is a perfect
		candidate for the union of academic and industrial
		minds.  The <b>Testing: Academic and Industrial
		Conference - Practice and Research Techniques</b>
		(TAIC PART) is a unique event that strives to combine
		the important aspects of a software
		testing <b>conference</b>, <b>workshop</b>, and
		<b>retreat</b>.
		
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      TAIC PART brings together
	      <b>industrialists</b> and <b>academics</b> in an
	      environment that promotes meaningful collaboration on
	      the challenges of software testing.  TAIC PART is
	      sponsored by representatives from both industry and
	      academia. The conference brings together software
	      developers, end users, and academic researchers who work
	      on both the <b>theory</b> and <b>practice</b> of
	      software testing.
	      </p>

     <h1>Special Features</h1>

	      <p>
		TAIC PART features an <b>international program
		committee</b> that will fairly evaluate all of the
		submitted papers and write three or more high quality,
		detailed reviews.  The <b>accepted papers</b> will be
		published with ISBN by the Conference Publishing
		Services (CPS) and they will appear in the IEEE
		digital library. A special issue of the <a href =
		"http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505732/description#description">Journal
		of Systems and Software</a> will also publish
		revisions of selected papers.  Finally, TAIC PART
		boasts <b>keynote addresses</b>, <b>networking
		opportunities</b>, and <b>social events</b>.
	      </p>		

	      <p>
	Alongside experience reports, research and tool papers, and
	industry and academic challenge articles, TAIC PART 2009 also
	has a <b>fast abstract option</b> that supports the
	publication of short papers describing
	<b>late breaking results</b> or <b>works in progress</b>.
	This TAIC PART track is an ideal venue for PhD students who
	are interested in feedback about dissertation research that is
	in its formative stages.  These two page papers will be
	published in the proceedings and their authors will present
	their papers alongside the other TAIC PART authors.
	</p>

     <h1>Conference Venue</h1>

            <p>
	      The conference will be held at Cumberland Lodge,
              Windsor, UK, September 4 - 6, 2009.
            <a href="http://www.cumberlandlodge.ac.uk/">Cumberland
              lodge</a> is a former royal residence given to the
              nation in 1946 by the late Queen Mother.  It is an ideal
              setting for a productive and enjoyable conference,
              providing world-class conference facilities in an ideal
              location that resonates with centuries of historical
              significance, dating back to the mid 17th century.  Set
              in the heart of Windsor Great Park, yet only 27 miles
              from London and a short distance from Heathrow, it is
              perfectly placed for visitors from home and abroad. Food
              and domestic standards are very high and the atmosphere
              is that of a friendly country house.  As you are
              planning your trip to Windsor, please consult the following
