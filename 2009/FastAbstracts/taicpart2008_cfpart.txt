-----------------
  Theme and Goals
-----------------

   The Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference 2008 (TAIC PART
   2008) establishes a forum for the publication of papers related to
   software testing and analysis.  The theme of TAIC PART is
   "transferring software testing technology from academia to
   industry."  TAIC PART aims to forge collaborations between industry
   and academia.  A goal of TAIC PART 2008 is the articulation of
   fundamental research questions in the field of software testing and
   analysis.  TAIC PART also focuses on the practical challenges that
   are often faced by software developers in industry.

------------------------
  Call for Participation
------------------------

   After a rigorous reviewing process in which all of the submitted
   papers were reviewed by at least three programme committee members,
   followed by programme committee discussions, 15 papers were
   accepted for publication at TAIC PART 2008.  Four of these papers
   were from industry, eight from academia, and three from
   collaborations between industry and academia.  In addition to the
   published papers, TAIC PART 2008 has two outstanding invited
   speakers, Les Hatton of Kingston University and Oakwood Computing,
   and David Vandervoort of Testronic Labs.

   TAIC PART 2006 and 2007 were assessed outstanding and
   internationally leading in all categories by the EPSRC, who
   provided significant funding to hold these past events. The
   criteria included research quality, planning and practice,
   scientific impact, communication of output, and benefits to
   society. The conference organizers invite you to participate in
   TAIC PART 2008 in order to continue the strong tradition of this
   software testing conference.

  Call for Fast Abstracts
-------------------------

   TAIC PART 2008 also features a Fast Abstract Track that supports
   the publication of short papers describing late breaking results or
   works in progress. This TAIC PART track is an ideal venue for PhD
   students who are interested in feedback about dissertation research
   that is in its formative stages. These two page papers will be
   available for download from the conference Web Site and authors
   will present their papers alongside the other TAIC PART authors. As
   the Important Dates indicate, there is still time to submit a fast
   abstract.  More information is available at:
