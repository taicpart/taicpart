<h3>Speaker  Biography</h3>	
<p> 
Andreas Zeller is computer science professor at Saarland University;
he researches large programs and their history, and has developed a
number of methods to determine the causes of program failures - on
open-source programs as well as in industrial contexts at IBM,
Microsoft, SAP and others.  His book "Why Programs Fail"  has
received the Software Development Magazine productivity award in 2006.

	<h3>Trends and Techniques in Unit Testing: From Daikon to Agitator and
Beyond</h3>

<p> 
Unit testing is a very effective strategy for improving the quality of
software, reducing its cost, and accelerating its development.  Despite
its widely recognized benefits, unit testing is practiced by only a
minority of developers. The slow adoption of unit testing is largely due
to the lack of tools that automate the tedious and time-consuming
aspects of this practice. Motivated by the need for a solution and
inspired by the research in test-input generation and automatic
discovery of program specifications, we devised a unit-testing technique
called software agitation. We implemented this technique in Agitator, a
commercial testing engine that is part of our comprehensive testing
product called AgitarOne.
<p> 
 
</p> 
In this talk I will trace Agitator's research lineage, emphasizing the
tradeoffs between completeness, correctness, usability, and performance
that were necessary to create a commercially successful product.  I will
also describe how the Agitator engine is used for automatic generation
of characterization tests that can be used to tackle the legacy code
problem.  Finally, I will offer some insights, based on our hard-learned
lessons, on what it takes to transition research results into tools that
can be deployed in software development trenches.

<h3>Speaker Biography</h3>	
 
<p>	
Marat Boshernitsan is a researcher and a software developer who is
curious about how humans create software.  Marat's research focuses on
building tools that empower software developers to create higher quality
and more maintainable software, while not getting in the way of their
work.  Marat currently indulges his interests as the Director of
Research at Agitar Software, where he works on a wide range of software
development problems related to automated testing of software.  In the
past Marat has worked on a program editor that provided
typographically-grounded automatic formatting to improve readability of
source code (at SunLabs) and on a system for automating systematic
source code editing using interactive code transformations (as part of
his dissertation research).  Marat received his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of California, Berkeley under the direction
of Susan Graham.
