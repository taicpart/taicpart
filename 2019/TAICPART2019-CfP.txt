TAIC PART 2019 -- 14th Workshop on Testing: Academia-Industry Collaboration,
Practice and Research Techniques
2019/
 
April 22, 2019, Xi'an, China
Co-located with IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification
and Validation (ICST 2019)


+++ Important Dates +++
 
Submission: January 21, 2019 (extended)
Notification: February 9, 2019
Camera-ready: February 15, 2019
Workshop: April 22, 2019
  
+++ Theme and Goals +++
 
TAIC PART is a workshop that aims to forge collaboration between
industry and academia on the challenging and exciting problem of
real-world software testing. It is promoted by representatives of both
industry and academia, bringing together industrial software engineers
and testers with researchers working on theory and practice of
software testing. TAIC PART expects submissions relevant to practice
and research like evaluation of testing approaches by means of
industrial surveys, case studies or experiments, experience reports on
the application of scientific approaches in industry, or ideas on how
to facilitate the knowledge transfer between industry and academia.

The goals of TAIC PART range from the articulation of research
questions in the field of software testing and analysis to practical
challenges faced in industry. The common theme is the discussion and
advancement of approaches and methods for sustainable collaboration
between academia and industry in software testing.
  
+++ Topics of Interest +++
 
TAIC PART invites submissions relevant to practice and research including
 
+ Industry experience reports: practical and generalizable insights into how to
  apply and extend existing approaches to software testing and analysis
+ Research methods for collaborative research: ways that industry and academia
  can collaborate to further knowledge on testing, verification and validation
+ Industrial challenges with real-world testing: describe a real-world software
  testing problem for which industry seeks help from academia or vice versa
+ Knowledge exchange between industry and academia: how can new results and
  knowledge be exchanged between the two partners

  
+++ Submission and Proceedings +++


+ Regular Papers (6 pages): Experience reports, research methods, longer 
  challenge papers (optional up to 10 pages)
+ Fast Abstracts (up to 2 pages): Challenges in practice and research, work 
  in progress, positions statements
 
Regular papers will be evaluated with respect to the real-world
significance of the described testing experience as well as their
ability to forge partnerships and ultimately yield successful
solutions. Fast Abstract papers are short papers that describe late
breaking results, works in progress or real-world challenges and will
be evaluated according to their ability to generate discussion and
suggest interesting areas for future research.

Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper through the TAIC
PART 2019 paper submission site:
http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=taicpart2019. Papers must be
written in English and conform to the two-column IEEE template for
conference proceedings. All papers will undergo a rigorous review by
at least three members of the program committee. All accepted papers
will be part of the ICST joint workshop proceedings published in the
IEEE Digital Library.
