	</p>
	
	<p>
As Corporate Director of IBM Quality Software Engineering, Bill
Woodworth has a three fold responsibility: 1) increase the IBM-wide
focus on testing of all software products and solutions, 2) based upon
the success achieved in #1 for testers, do the same for all IBM software
developers, and 3) drive the continuing focus on improving the
reliability/ availability of our integrated customer solutions. In this
role, Bill was leading both the company wide 'Testers Community' and
'Developers Community'.  In 2005, these were integrated into one unified
'Quality thru Software Engineering (QSE) Community', which under Bill's
leadership, is teaming and facilitating the units across IBM into a
"best of breed" standard of software engineering, so the units are
achieving their business goals by applying better software engineering.</p>
<p>With 25 years of product development and test management experience, he
has achieved proven and consistent successes through leading
results-oriented and quality-focused processes in the software
development business.</p>

	<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~hatcliff">Dr. John Hatcliff</a>
is a Professor in the Computing and Information
Sciences Department at Kansas State University (KSU) and leads the KSU
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/santos">
Laboratory for Specification, Analysis, and Transformation of Software
(SAnToS)</a>.  SAnToS researchers have produced a number of techniques and
tools that seek to enable effective construction of high-confidence
software systems including
the <a href="http://cadena.projects.cis.ksu.edu">Cadena</a>
model-driven development and analysis environment,
the <a href="http://bogor.projects.cis.ksu.edu">Bogor</a>
extensible software model checking framework,
the <a href="http://indus.projects.cis.ksu.edu">Indus</a>
Java slicing framework,
and the <a href="http://bandera.projects.cis.ksu.edu">Bandera</a>
Java model-checking framework.
</p>
<p>
SAnToS relies on extensive interaction with industrial partners
including Boeing (Phantom Works, St. Louis), Lockheed Martin, and
Rockwell-Collins to gain insight into particular foundational advances
and tool capabilities that will be necessary to affect practice.
Dr. Hatcliff and other SAnToS Researchers were members of the NASA
Java Pathfinder Team that in 2003 received NASA's Turning Goals Into
Reality (TGIR) Award -- one of fifteen awards given to NASA projects
in 2003 that best demonstrated progress toward NASA's mission
objectives. In May 2005, the SAnToS Cadena environment was used by Boeing
engineers to develop the avionics software flown on the Scan Eagle
Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) platform for the US Department of Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Program Composition for
Embedded Systems capstone demo at the US White Sands Missile Range.
