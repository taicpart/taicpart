			<P><i>Abstract:</i> An automotive system is a Cyber-Physical System. Software, on the one hand, brings new values and features such as "Connected Car" by its flexibility. 
			On the other hand, embedded software is required to achieve safety and reliability as a part of control systems. The trend suggests that it is necessary to consider 
			analysis and verification activities from the software perspective in addition to the conventional system analysis. This talk will provide topics related to analysis 
			and verification including testing in the automotive embedded software field.</P>

				<strong>Coverage-Based Reduction of Test Execution Time: Lessons from a Very Large Industrial Project</strong> &nbsp; (<a href="slides/TAICPART2017-Bach-CoverageBasedReductionOfTestExecutionTime.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gaHandleDownloads('click-slides', 'slides-bach')">slides</a>)<br>

				<i>Abstract:</i> There exist several coverage-based approaches to reduce time and resource costs of test execution. While these methods are well-investigated and evaluated for smaller to medium-size projects, we faced several challenges in applying them in the context of a very large industrial software project, namely SAP HANA. These issues include: varying effectiveness of algorithms for test case selection/prioritization, large amounts of shared (non-specific) coverage between different tests, high redundancy of coverage data, and nondeterminism of test results (i.e. flaky tests), as well as of the coverage data (e.g. due to concurrency issues). We address these issues by several approaches. First, our study shows that compared to standard algorithms, so-called overlap-aware solvers can yield up to 50% higher code coverage in a fixed test time budget. This can significantly increase the effectiveness of test case prioritization and selection. We also found that in our project the redundancy of line coverage is up to 97%, providing opportunities for data size reduction. Finally, we show that removal of coverage shared by tests can significantly increase test specificity. Our analysis and approaches can help to narrow the gap between research and practice in context of coverage-based testing approaches, especially in case of very large software projects.

				<strong>Are CISQ Reliability Measures Practical?

				<i>Abstract:</i> The Object Management Group (OMG), which is driven by industry, proposes an operational standard for measuring reliability by providing specifications for 29 reliability measures. The goal of this article is to systematically assess whether (1) the provided measurement specifications are suitable to be used as basis for a static test tool implementation and (2) the measures are suitable for capturing reliability issues in software. The implementation of the CISQ measures (CISQ is the consortium responsible for driving the quality related topics of the OMG) for Java showed that the specifications in the standard are language independent and at some points imprecise. Thus, it was necessary to define assumptions for their implementation. Furthermore, some measures are not applicable for Java. Applying our CISQ-based measurement tool in a case study on several versions of an open source project showed that CISQ measures properties that are vital for fulfilling reliability requirements. In the course of the case study, the engineers of the open source project fixed a number of issues identified by our CISQ tooling as they considered them to be critical. While a number of findings provided by us were considered to be reasonable, they could not be fixed since the engineers did not have the code ownership. In these cases, they proposed improvement suggestions to the responsible teams.

				<strong>Impact of Education and Experience Level on the Effectiveness of Exploratory Testing: An <br>Industrial Case Study</strong> &nbsp; (<a href="slides/TAICPART2017-Gebizli-ImpactOfEducationAndExperienceOnExploratoryTesting.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gaHandleDownloads('click-slides', 'slides-gebizli')">slides</a>)<br>

				<i>Abstract:</i> Exploratory Testing (ET) is a widely applied approach in practice. This approach relies on the knowledge and experience of test engineers and technicians who perform ET. Hence, we aimed at evaluating the impact of education and experience level on the effectiveness of ET. We conducted an industrial case study for this purpose. 19 practitioners, who have different educational backgrounds and experience levels, were involved in applying ET for testing a Digital TV system. We measured the number of detected defects and categorized these defects based on their severity. We evaluated effectiveness from two aspects: criticality of the detected defects and efficiency in terms of number of defects detected per unit of time. The results show that the efficiency of ET is significantly affected by both the educational background and experience. When it comes to the number of critical defects detected, we cannot observe any impact of education on results. However, experience level has a significant impact for this aspect as well.

				<strong>A Test Case Recommendation Method Based on Morphological Analysis, Clustering and <br>the Mahalanobis-Taguchi Method</strong> &nbsp; (<a href="slides/TAICPART2017-Aman-TestCaseRecommendationBasedOnMahalanobisTaguchi.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gaHandleDownloads('click-slides', 'slides-aman')">slides</a>)<br>

				<i>Abstract:</i> This paper focuses on the content of test cases, and categorizes test cases into clusters using the similarity between test cases; their degree of similarity is obtained through a morphological analysis. If there are two similar test cases, they would test the same or similar functionalities in similar but different conditions. Thus, when one of them is run for a regression testing, the remaining one should be run as well, in order to reduce a risk of overlooking regressions. Once a test engineer decides to run a set of test cases, the method proposed in this paper can recommend adding similar test cases to their candidate set. The proposed method also considers the priorities of recommended test cases by using the Mahalanobis-Taguchi method. This paper reports on an empirical study with an industry software product. The results show that the proposed method is useful in preventing the overlooking of regressions.

				<strong>Results of a Comparative Study of Code Coverage Tools in Computer Vision</strong> &nbsp; (<a href="slides/TAICPART2017-Wotawa-ComparativeStudyOfCodeCoverageTools.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gaHandleDownloads('click-slides', 'slides-wotawa')">slides</a>)<br>

				<i>Abstract:</i> The high quality of computer vision (CV) software has a great impact on the usability of the overall CV systems in real world scenarios. As the usage of standardized quality assurance methods, metrics and tools can ease the work of any CV developer and quickly improve the overall process, we report here on the introduction of code coverage analysis in the field. Our initial motivations were both to understand the available test coverage tools and to compare them in order to answer the questions of which test coverage tool to prefer in the area of CV software and whether we can introduce some specific evaluation criteria for identifying the right tool to be used within a CV project. The readers may use this study to help choose the right coverage testing tools for their needs and environment. This article is also valuable to those who are new to the practice and the art of software coverage testing, as it is generally the case for CV people.

				<strong>Test Case Generation and Prioritization: A Process-mining Approach</strong> &nbsp; (<a href="slides/TAICPART2017-Janes-TestCaseGenerationAndPrioritizationProcessMining.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="gaHandleDownloads('click-slides', 'slides-janes')">slides</a>)<br>

				<i>Abstract:</i> Test cases are an essential tool in software quality assurance: they ensure that code behaves as specified in the requirement. However, writing test cases does not have only benefits, it comes with a cost: the programmer has to formulate the test cases and maintain them when the tested source code changes. Such costs become prohibitive for start-ups or small enterprises, which often prefer to invest their time into the development of new functionalities instead of testing. This paper explores the use of process-mining as an approach to create a model of how users interact with a system to a) generate test cases and b) prioritize them. Using process-mining, it is possible to mine from the user behavior which parts of the system are the most used, in which order they are executed, generate test cases repeating user input, and prioritizing test cases.

			<P><i>Abstract:</i> Collaboration between industry and academia is important for solving problems and creating innovations. Both sides of industry and academia are important for each other, but sometimes they are incompatible. The keynote provides an overview of software testing in industry and academia from their respective views in Japan. It explores the influence of economic circumstances on the development of high quality software and it discusses related problems such as cost reductions, production of high quality software, and adapting businesses. The author shares experiences from solving these problems by collaborating with people from both industry and academia, for example, by developing test methodologies, skill standards, and education syllabi.</P>
