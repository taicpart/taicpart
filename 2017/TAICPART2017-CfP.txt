Practice and Research Techniques
http://www.taicpart.org/
 
March, 2017, Tokyo, Japan
Co-located with IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification
and Validation (ICST 2017)


+++ Important Dates +++
 
Submission: December 8, 2016
Notification: January 2, 2017
Workshop: March 13, 2017

  
+++ Theme and Goals +++
 
TAIC PART is a workshop co-located with ICST 2017 that aims to forge collaboration 
between industry and academia on the challenging and exciting problem of 
real-world software testing. It is promoted by representatives of both industry 
and academia, bringing together industrial software engineers and testers with 
researchers working on theory and practice of software testing.
 
The goals of TAIC PART range from the articulation of research questions in the 
field of software testing and analysis to practical challenges faced in industry. 
The common theme is the discussion and advancement of approaches and methods for 
sustainable collaboration between academia and industry in software testing.

  
+++ Topics of Interest +++
 
TAIC PART invites submissions relevant to practice and research including
 
+ Industry experience reports: practical and generalizable insights into how to
  apply and extend existing approaches to software testing and analysis
+ Research methods for collaborative research: ways that industry and academia
  can collaborate to further knowledge on testing, verification and validation
+ Industrial challenges with real-world testing: describe a real-world software
  testing problem for which industry seeks help from academia or vice versa
+ Knowledge exchange between industry and academia: how can new results and
  knowledge be exchanged between the two partners

  
+++ Submission and Proceedings +++
 
+ Regular Papers (6 pages): Experience reports, research papers, longer challenge
  papers (extension up to 10 pages may be possible on request)
+ Fast Abstracts (up to 2 pages): Challenges in practice and research, work in
  progress, positions statements
 
Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper through the TAIC PART 2017
paper submission site: http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=taicpart2017.
All accepted papers will be part of the ICST joint workshop proceedings published
in the IEEE Digital Library.

Best paper award: Win an iPad! The best paper will be selected from the submitted 
regular papers based on the reviews by the program committee.
