    <h1>Conference Venue</h1>

            <p>
	      The conference will be held at Cumberland Lodge,
              Windsor, UK, August 29-31, 2008.
            <a href="http://www.cumberlandlodge.ac.uk/">Cumberland
              lodge</a> is a former royal residence given to the
              nation in 1946 by the late Queen Mother.  It is an ideal
              setting for a productive and enjoyable conference,
              providing world-class conference facilities in an ideal
              location that resonates with centuries of historical
              significance, dating back to the mid 17th century.  Set
              in the heart of Windsor Great Park, yet only 27 miles
              from London and a short distance from Heathrow, it is
              perfectly placed for visitors from home and abroad. Food
              and domestic standards are very high and the atmosphere
              is that of a friendly country house.   As you are
              planning your trip to Windsor, please consult the following
	      <a href =
	      "http://www.cumberlandlodge.ac.uk/contactus/directions_to_cumberland_lodge/">travel
	      advice from Cumberland Lodge</a>.
	    </p>

	    <h1>Registration</h1>

	    <p>
	      Due to recently received sponsorship from the <a href =
	      "http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/default.htm">EPSRC</a>, we are
	      now pleased to offer a reduced registration rate of
	      &#163;320 (&#163;250 for students) that includes the
	      conference fee, all accommodation and meals for the
	      duration of the conference (10:00 on Friday, August 29
	      to 16:00 on Sunday, August 31), and a printed copy of
	      the proceedings.  Participants may register for TAIC
	      PART 2008 by downloading the registration form, as
	      a <a href = "RegistrationTaicPart08.doc">DOC</a>
	      or <a href = "RegistrationTaicPart08.pdf">PDF</a> file,
	      and then returning it by fax or email.  Please refer to
	      the registration form for more details about the
	      submission of the registration documents and payments.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      	      Registration must be completed by August 19,
2008. Moreover, we suggest that you register quickly since places at
the conference are very limited and priority is given to paper
presenters.  Since the Cumberland Lodge has no vacancies before or
after TAIC PART 2008, conference attendees who intend to stay in the
United Kingdom before August 29 or after August 31 cannot stay at the
conference hotel.  Please consult a list of
	      <a href =
	      "AccomodationsInTheAreaTAICPART2008.pdf">accommodation
	      alternatives</a> for suggestions concerning lodging that
	      is close to the Cumberland Lodge.  Participants are
	      encouraged to contact the <a href =
	      "../Organization/index.php">conference organizers</a> if
	      they require visa invitation letters or have other
	      questions about TAIC PART 2008.
	      </p>
