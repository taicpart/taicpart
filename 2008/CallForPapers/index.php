  <h1>Themes and Goals</h1>

  <p>
    The <b>Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference 2008</b> (TAIC
    PART 2008) establishes a forum for the publication of papers
    related to software testing and analysis.  The theme of TAIC PART is
    <b>transferring software testing technology from academia to
    industry</b>.  TAIC PART aims to forge collaborations between
    industry and academia.  The goals of TAIC PART 2008 include the
    articulation of <b>fundamental research questions</b> in the field
    of software testing and analysis.  TAIC PART also focuses on the
    <b>practical challenges</b> that are often faced by software
    developers in industry.
  </p>

  <h1>Types of Papers</h1>

  <ul>

    <li> <b>Experience</b> reports should provide practical and
      generalizable insights into how to apply and extend existing
      approaches to software testing and analysis. <p>

    <li> <b>Tool</b> papers must focus on the design, implementation,
      and evaluation of software testing and analysis tools. <p>

    <li> <b>Original Research</b> papers will explore novel software
      testing techniques.  These papers should furnish a detailed
      theoretical and/or empirical evaluation of the proposed
      approach. <p>

    <li> <b>Industry Challenge</b> papers must have at least one author
      whose affiliation in non-academic.  These papers will describe a
      real-world software testing problem for which help is sought
      from the academic research community. <p>

    <li> <b>Academic Challenge</b> papers must have at least one author
      whose affiliation in non-industry.  These papers should explain a
      software testing research problem for which help is sought from
      industry partners. <p>

    </ul>

  <h1>Paper Evaluation</h1>

      <p>
	All papers will undergo a <b>rigorous examination</b> by at
	least three members of the program committee. The program
	co-chairs and the program pommittee will provide thoughtful
	and fair reviews that furnish detailed insights into ways for
	improving and extending the papers.  <b>All submitted
	papers</b> will be evaluated according to (i) relevance to the
	conference themes and goals and (ii) clarity and organization.
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li> <b>Experience reports</b> will be evaluated with respect
	to the significance and generality of the described testing
	experience. <p>

	<li> <b>Research</b> and <b>tool</b> papers will be judged by
	  the technical merit, novelty, and evaluation of the
	  described technique or tool. <p>

	<li> <b>Industry and academic challenge</b> papers will be
	    assessed according to their ability to forge partnerships
	    and ultimately yield successful solutions. <p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        The results described in the submitted paper must
	be <b>unpublished</b> and should <b>not be under review</b> at
	other workshops, conferences, or journals.
      </p>

  <h1>Paper Formatting</h1>

      <p>
	Papers should be formatted using the IEEE conference style
	format. Including all references and figures,
	a <b>research</b> paper must not exceed the <b>ten page</b>
	limit and the <b>experience</b>, <b>tool</b>, and <b>industry
	and academic challenge</b> papers should be not longer
	than <b>five pages</b>.  Papers should have an abstract that
	is no longer than 150 words. Please be aware that if your
	paper is accepted, the abstract may appear in the advance
	program and on the TAIC PART 2008 Web site. Authors should
	submit a PDF version of their paper through the <a href =
	"../SubmitPaper/index.php">Submit Paper</a> Web site.
      </p>

  <h1>Conference Proceedings</h1>

      <p>
	The <b>accepted papers</b> will be published with ISBN by the
	IEEE Computer Society and they will appear in the IEEE digital
	library.  The presentations for all of the accepted papers
	will also be provided for download on the TAIC PART 2008 Web
	site.  The Conference Chair and Program Co-Chairs have
	arranged for a special section of <a href =
	"http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/525444/description#description">Information
